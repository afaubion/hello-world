# hello-world
from the Github tutorial
Now I have created a new branch off of the master branch as well as:
-editing the file

on github saved changes are called "Commits"
-each commit has an associated commit message ( a description explaining why the particular change was made)

to make and commit a change
1. Click the [FILENAME.md] file
2. Click the "pencil" icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit
3.in the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4.Write a commit message that descirbes your changes 
5.Click "Commit changes" button.
